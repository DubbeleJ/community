# SubState Machines

[The SubState Machines page](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/substatemachine_Dezyne2_5_x) explains how a sub-state machine can be implemented, even without the native support of sub-state-machine syntax in the dezyne language. (native support is currently under development)

[This page](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/logging) describes a way to inject a StreamLogger class into the locator to re-direct the logging to your own logger intra-structure. Also it goes into how it is possible to customize the log information coming out of dezyne models by customizing the runtime.
